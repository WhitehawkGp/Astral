    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This site was made by The TALW.</p>
    <p>In Middle School there were these kids who didn't follow the rules much, like not the ones that could get you in big trouble, but the ones that most teachers didn't really care(unless you make them mad about) and we're talking about playing video games on the school chromebooks. And then soon after they found out how to play minecraft on it. So after they made an organiztion that is dedicated to unblockers, ealgercraft, and games. But sharing the websites by mouth, and remember them was hard so they made this, a place with almost every site they know.</p>
