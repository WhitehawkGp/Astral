    <h2>Info</h2>
   <p>This page holds the key to playing Roblox</p>
    <p>The reason for some schools of why roblox is so hard to get is usually they block or use some sort of internet that doesn't allow you play to Roblox</p>
    <p>A good way to counter this as many school's have staff wifi or guest wifi which don't have the same settings as others, for example we will use Chromebook-wifi the chromebook wifi blocks games like Roblox or Bloxd io so if we go to for example Guest-wifi the settings could possibly be different and most likey will require a password, neither you find the password or you a third party connection method this could be a hostspot or anything that can provide wifi after you do that problem you need to get past you're school's firewall which can be pretty simple if you know what you're doing a method for this "Core keys Corruption" there is a github repos for it, but the one used for this is very light as soon you close your device the firewall software reboots and is fine again, but you still can play Roblox. All you have to do after you do that is just go to now.gg and click Roblox and you can play steal a brainrot!<div>
